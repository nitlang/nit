# A procedural program (without explicit class).
# It displays the value of a local variable.
# It exhibs ways to concatenate strings.

var a = 10
# First way: Multiple parameters.
# Pro: Simple.
# Con: Only for multi parameters methods.
printn("The value of a is: ", a, ".\n")

# Second way: Build a string and display it.
# Pro: Eiffel way (rigourous).
# Con: Eiffel way (heavy).
var s: Buffer = new FlatBuffer.from("The value of a is: ")
s.append(a.to_s)
s.append(".\n")
printn(s)

# Third way: Use a intern string evaluation.
# Pro: Script way (easy).
# Con: Script way (unreadeable on complexes cases).
printn("The value of a is: {a}.\n")

# Fourth way: String concatenation
# Pro: Easy.
# Con: Unefficient (slow and consumes memory).
printn("The value of a is: " + a.to_s + ".\n")

# Fiveth way: Join arrays.
# Pro: Sometime efficient on complex concatenation.
# Con: Crazy.
printn(["The value of a is: ", a.to_s, ".\n"].join)
