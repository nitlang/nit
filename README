Nit is a statically typed object-oriented programming language.
The goal of Nit is to propose a statically typed programming language where structure is not a pain.

Nit has a simple straightforward style and can usually be picked up quickly, particularly by anyone who has programmed before.
While object-oriented, it allows procedural styles.

The Nit Compiler (nitc) produces efficient machine language binaries.

Some Nit features:
 * Pure Object-Oriented.
 * Multiple Inheritance.
 * Realist typing policy.
 * Light and clear syntax.


Requirement:
	
	* gcc		http://gcc.gnu.org/
