## What is Nit?

Nit is an expressive language with a script-like syntax, a friendly type-system and aims at elegance, simplicity and intuitiveness.

Nit has a simple straightforward style and can usually be picked up quickly, particularly by anyone who has programmed before.
While object-oriented, it allows procedural styles.

WORKDIR /work

# Copy the source code in /work/
COPY . /work/

# Compile
RUN nitc src/hello.nit --dir . \
	# Clear disk space
	&& ccache -C
# You can also use a Makefile or any build system you want.
