# Example of simple module that aims to do some specific work on nit programs.
#
# Fast prototypes can just start with this skeleton.
module test_test_phase

# We need the framework that performs standard code for the main-program
import test_phase

# We usualy need specific phases
# NOTE: `frontend` is sufficient in most cases (it is often too much)
import frontend

# The body of the specific work.
# The main entry point is provided by `test_phase`,
# This function is then automatically (unless errors where found).
