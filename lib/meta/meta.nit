# Simple user-defined meta-level to manipulate types of instances as object.
#
# Unfortunately, since the meta-objects are user-defined they are provided without
# any pre-defined information or behavior.
# For the same reasons, the Nit OO mechanisms do not rely on this user-defined meta-level.
#
# However `meta` permits the definition of user-defined meta-classes at any level
# of meta, even with user-defined meta-loops.
#
# ## Meta-classes
#
# Meta-classes can be defined easily in 3 steps:
#
# * define a root for the class hierarchy (eg `XObject`)
# * define a meta-class (eq `XClass[E: XObject] super Class[E]`)
# * redefine `CLASS` and `class_factory` in the root
#
# ~~~nitish because broke with nitc, see Limitation bellow
# class XObject
#    redef CLASS: XClass[SELF]
#    redef class_factory(name) do return new XClass[SELF](name)
# end
# class XClass[E: XObject] super Class[E] end
#
# var x1 = new XObject
# var x2 = new XObject
# assert x1.get_class == x2.get_class
# assert x1.get_class isa XClass[XObject]
# assert x1.get_class.get_class isa Class[XClass[XObject]]
# ~~~
#
# ## Limitation
#
# Currently works only with the interpreter `nit` and the compiler with `--erasure` (without `--rta`).
#
# `--rta` will try to detect all the runtime types, and will infinitely discover `Class[Class[Class[....]]]`.
# Unfortunately, `--separate` and `--global` require `--rta`.
#
# Moreover, the interpreter and `--erasure` have a different behavior with generics since
# with `--erasure` a single meta-instance is shared for all type variations of a same generic class.
#
# Class names are used as a primary key to identify classes.
# But name conflicts are not managed and will make the program crashes at runtime (on some cast error)

#
# This is one of the hackiest way to retrieve the name of a random type.

# ~~~

# end

# var g = new G[Bool]
# assert g.name_of_v == "Collection[Bool]"

#
# Warning: this does not work if --erasure is used.
