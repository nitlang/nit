# Redef _some_ basic collections to be thread-safe
#
# This modules is intended to be used with scripts or quick prototypes.
# It makes thread safe _all_ instances of _some_ collections which
# also slightly slow down single threaded use. For more robust software,
# it is recommended to use `threads::concurrent_collections`.
#
# Thread-safe collections:
#
# - [x] `Array`
# - [ ] `List`
# - [ ] `HashMap`
# - [ ] `HashSet`
# - [ ] `Ref`
# - [ ] `Queue`
