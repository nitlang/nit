# ANSI C signal handling
#
# Common usage imply 5 steps:
#
# 1. Implement the `SignalHandler` interface
# 2. `redef receive_signal_unsafe` to handle `sigsegv`
# 3. `redef receive_signal` to handle other signals safely
# 4, Notify what signals to handle with `handle_signal`
# 5. If using the safe handler method, routinely call `check_signals`
#
# Usage example:
#
# ~~~~
# class MyReceiver
#	super SignalHandler
#
#	redef fun receive_signal(signal)
#	do
#		print "received safely {signal}"
#		if signal == sigalarm then print "Alarm!"
#	end
#	redef fun receive_signal_unsafe( signal ) do print "received unsafely {signal}"
# end
#
# var r = new MyReceiver
#
# # Handle `sigsegv` signal unsafely (the only way for this one)
# r.handle_signal(sigsegv, false)
#
# # Handle `sigint` and `sigalarm` safely
# r.handle_signal(sigint, true)
# r.handle_signal(sigalarm, true)
#
# # Ask system to receive a `sigalarm` signal in 1 second
# set_alarm(1)
#
# loop
#	# Check signals and callback `receive_signal`
#	var hit = check_signals
#
#	if hit then break
# end
# ~~~~
