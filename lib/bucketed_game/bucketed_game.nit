# Game framework with an emphasis on efficient event coordination
#
# Provides basic game logic entities to manage a game where the logic is executed by turns:
# `Game`, `GameTurn`, `GameEvent`, `Turnable`.
# Also offers a bucket system to plan future events at a known number of turns in the future:
# `Bucketable` and the services `act_next` and `act_in`.
#
# Efficiently support large number of entities with rare or sparse actions,
# such as a forest with many individual trees growing slowly.
