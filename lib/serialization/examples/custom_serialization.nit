# Example of an ad hoc serializer that is tailored to transform business specific objects into customized representation.
#
# In the following, we expose 3 business classes, `E`, `A` and `B`, and a specific business serializer `RestrictedSerializer`.
# The principle is that the custom serialization logic in enclosed into the `RestrictedSerializer` and that the
# standard serializer is unchanged.
#
# The additional behaviors exposed are:
#
# * replace a full business object (see `E::id`):
#   instead of serializing an attribute, the custom serializer uses a different representation.
# * inject a phantom attribute (see `E::phantom`):
#   when serializing, the custom serializer injects new attributes.
# * hide a normally serialized attribute (see `E::semi_private`):
#   when serializing, the custom serializer hides some specific attributes.
#
# The advantage of the approach is that it is done programmatically so can be adapted to real complex use cases.
# Basically, this is half-way between the full automatic serialization and the full manual serialisation.

import serialization
import json::serialization_write

# The root class of the business objects.
# This factorizes most services and domain knowledge used by the `RestrictedSerializer`
#
# In real enterprise-level code, the various specific behaviors can be specified in more semantic classifiers.
abstract class E
	serialize

	# The semantic business identifier.
	#
	# With the `RestrictedSerializer`, references to `E` objects will be replaced with `id`-based information.
	# This avoid to duplicate or enlarge the information cross-call wise.
	#
	# A future API/REST call can then request the _missing_ object from its identifier.
	var id: String

	# A phantom attribute to be serialized by the custom `RestrictedSerializer`.
	#
	# This can be used to inject constant or computed information that make little sense to have as a genuine attribute in
	# the Nit model.
	fun phantom: String do return "So Much Fun"

	# An attribute not to be serialized by the custom `RestrictedSerializer`.
	# e.g. we want it on the DB but not in API/REST JSON messages
	#
	# Note that the annotation `noserialize` hides the attribute for all serializers.
	# To hide the attribute only in the `RestrictedSerializer`, it will have to actively ignore it.
