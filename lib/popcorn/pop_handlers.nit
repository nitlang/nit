# Route handlers.

# Class handler for a route.
#
# **Routing** refers to determining how an application responds to a client request
# to a particular endpoint, which is a URI (or path) and a specific HTTP request
# method GET, POST, PUT or DELETE (other methods are not suported yet).
#
# Each route can have one or more handler methods, which are executed when the route is matched.
#
# Route handlers definition takes the following form:
#
# ~~~nitish
# class MyHandler
#	super Handler
#
#	redef fun METHOD(req, res) do end
# end
# ~~~
#
# Where:
# * `MyHandler` is the name of the handler you will add to the app.
# * `METHOD` can be replaced by `get`, `post`, `put` or `delete`.
#
# The following example responds with `Hello World!` to GET and POST requests:
#
# ~~~
# class MyHandler
#	super Handler
#
#	redef fun get(req, res) do res.send "Got a GET request"
#	redef fun post(req, res) do res.send "Got a POST request"
# end
# ~~~
#
# To make your handler responds to a specific route, you have to add it to the app.
#
# Respond to POST request on the root route (`/`), the application's home page:
#
# ~~~
# var app = new App
# app.use("/", new MyHandler)
# ~~~
#
# Respond to a request to the `/user` route:
#
# ~~~
# app.use("/user", new MyHandler)
# ~~~

			if route isa AppParamRoute then
				req.uri_params = route.parse_uri_parameters(uri)
			end
			all(req, res)
		end
	end

	# Handler to all kind of HTTP request methods.
	#
	# `all` is a special request handler, which is not derived from any
	# HTTP method. This method is used to respond at a path for all request methods.
	#
	# In the following example, the handler will be executed for requests to "/user"
	# whether you are using GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, or any other HTTP request method.
	#

	#	super Handler
	#

# Static files server.
#
# To serve static files such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files, use the
# Popcorn built-in handler `StaticHandler`.
#
# Pass the name of the directory that contains the static assets to the StaticHandler
# init method to start serving the files directly.
# For example, use the following code to serve images, CSS files, and JavaScript files
# in a directory named `public`:
#
# ~~~
# var app = new App
# app.use("/", new StaticHandler("public/"))
# ~~~
#
# Now, you can load the files that are in the `public` directory:
#
# ~~~raw
# http://localhost:3000/images/trollface.jpg
# http://localhost:3000/css/style.css
# http://localhost:3000/js/app.js
# http://localhost:3000/hello.html
# ~~~
#
# Popcorn looks up the files relative to the static directory, so the name of the
# static directory is not part of the URL.
# To use multiple static assets directories, add the `StaticHandler` multiple times:
#
# ~~~
# app.use("/", new StaticHandler("public/"))
# app.use("/", new StaticHandler("files/"))
# ~~~
#
# Popcorn looks up the files in the order in which you set the static directories
# with the `use` method.
#
# To create a virtual path prefix (where the path does not actually exist in the file system)
# for files that are served by the `StaticHandler`, specify a mount path for the
# static directory, as shown below:
#
# ~~~
# app.use("/static/", new StaticHandler("public/"))
# ~~~
#
# Now, you can load the files that are in the public directory from the `/static`
# path prefix.
#
# ~~~raw
# http://localhost:3000/static/images/trollface.jpg
# http://localhost:3000/static/css/style.css
# http://localhost:3000/static/js/app.js
# http://localhost:3000/static/hello.html
# ~~~
#
# However, the path that you provide to the `StaticHandler` is relative to the
# directory from where you launch your app.
# If you run the app from another directory, it’s safer to use the absolute path of
# the directory that you want to serve.
class StaticHandler
	super Handler

	# Static files directory to serve.
	var static_dir: String

	# Default file to serve if nothing matches the request.
	#
	# `null` for no default file.
	var default_file: nullable String

	# Internal file server used to lookup and render files.

# Mountable routers
#
# Use the `Router` class to create modular, mountable route handlers.
# A Router instance is a complete middleware and routing system; for this reason,
# it is often referred to as a “mini-app”.
#
# The following example creates a router as a module, loads a middleware handler in it,
# defines some routes, and mounts the router module on a path in the main app.
#
# ~~~

# user_router.use("/profile", new UserProfile)
#
# var app = new App
# app.use("/", new AppHome)
# app.use("/user", user_router)

# The app will now be able to handle requests to /user and /user/profile, as well
# as call the `Time` middleware handler that is specific to the route.

# Popcorn application.
#
# The `App`  is the main point of the application.
# It acts as a `Router` that holds the top level route handlers.
#
# Here an example to create a simple web app with Popcorn:
#
# ~~~
# import popcorn
#
# class HelloHandler
#	super Handler
#
#	redef fun get(req, res) do res.html "<h1>Hello World!</h1>"
# end
#
# var app = new App
# app.use("/", new HelloHandler)
# # app.listen("localhost", 3000)
# ~~~
#
# The Popcorn app listens on port 3000 for connections.
# The app responds with "Hello World!" for request to the root URL (`/`) or **route**.
# For every other path, it will respond with a **404 Not Found**.
#
# The `req` (request) and `res` (response) parameters are the same that nitcorn provides
# so you can do anything else you would do in your route without Popcorn involved.
#
# Run the app with the following command:
#
# ~~~bash
# nitc app.nit && ./app
# ~~~
#
# Then, load [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a browser to see the output.
