# Basic framework for search problems and solver.
#
# The module provides a simple abstract class `SearchProblem[S,A]` to be specialized for a specific problem.
#
# The concrete class `SearchSolver` is used to configure, query, and run a solver for a given problem.
#
# For an example, see the `puzzle.nit` program in the `examples` subdirectory.

import realtime
import trees

# Abstract search problem over immutable states (`S`) and actions (`A`).
#
# This class serves to model problems of planing and path-finding.
# A state, `S`, is a point in the search problem and fully models a given state of the world.
# An action, `A`, is an available mean of transition between two states.
#
# This abstract class is generic made to work with any kind of states and actions.
# Therefore, specific subclasses must be developed to implement the required services:
#
# * `initial_state`
# * `actions`
# * `apply_action`
# * `is_goal`
#
# Note that the implemented methods should not temper with the parameters since it is expected
# that they remain unmodified.
#
#
# # Basic search
#
# These tree method are enough to trigger a basic search.
#
# The methods `breadth_first` and `depth_first` return pre-configured solvers for, respectively,
# a breadth-first search, a depth-first search.
#
#
# # Advanced search
#
# The `cost` method can be implemented to represent the cost of a single transition.
# By default, the cost is 1.
#
# The `heuristic` method can be implemented to represent a lower-bound estimation of the remaining
# cost to reach a goal state.
# By default, the heuristic is 0.
#
# If one of these (or both) methods are implemented, the `astar` method will return a pre-configured
# solver for a A* search.
#
# More configuration and optimization on the search can to be done in the `SearchSolver` class.
