# The root of the class hierarchy.
#
# Each other class implicitly specializes Object,
# therefore the services of Object are inherited by every other class and are usable
# on each value, including primitive types like integers (`Int`), strings (`String`) and arrays (`Array`).
#
# Note that `nullable Object`, not `Object`, is the root of the type hierarchy
# since the special value `null` is not considered as an instance of Object.
interface Object
	# Type of this instance, automatically specialized in every class
	#
	# A common use case of the virtual type `SELF` is to type an attribute and
	# store another instance of the same type as `self`. It can also be used as as
	# return type to a method producing a copy of `self` or returning an instance
	# expected to be the exact same type as self.
	#
	# This virtual type must be used with caution as it can hinder specialization.
	# In fact, it imposes strict restrictions on all sub-classes and their usage.
	# For example, using `SELF` as a return type of a method `foo`
	# forces all subclasses to ensure that `foo` returns the correct and updated
	# type.
	# A dangerous usage take the form of a method typed by `SELF` which creates
	# and returns a new instance.
	# If not correctly specialized, this method would break when invoked on a
	# sub-class.
	#
	# A general rule for safe usage of `SELF` is to ensure that inputs typed
	# `SELF` are stored in attributes typed `SELF` and returned by methods typed
	# `SELF`, pretty much the same things as you would do with parameter types.
	type SELF: Object

	# An internal hash code for the object based on its identity.
	#
	# Unless specific code, you should not use this method but
	# use `hash` instead.
	#
	# As its name hints it, the internal hash code, is used internally
	# to provide a hash value.
	# It is also used by the `inspect` method to loosely identify objects

	# * Two instances of different classes MIGHT share the same `object_id`.
	# * The `object_id` of a garbage-collected instance MIGHT be reused by new instances.
	# * The `object_id` of an object MIGHT be non constant across different executions.

	# (or the other way around).
