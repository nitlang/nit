# Services to manipulate `Date`, `Time` and `DateTime`
#
# The services are split in 2 classes:
#
# * `Date` handles the year, month and day parts of the date.
# * `Time` handles the time in hours, minutes and seconds.
#
# These are united in `DateTime` for a precise time in a precise day.
#
# ~~~
# var now = new Time.now
# var midnight = new Time(0, 0, 0)
# assert now > midnight
#
# var nine_thirty = new Time(9, 30, 0)
# var eleven_twenty = new Time(11, 20, 0)
# assert eleven_twenty > nine_thirty
#
# var pi_day = new Date(2015, 03, 14)
# var may_the_fourth = new Date(2015, 5, 4)
# assert pi_day < may_the_fourth

# var now_t = new DateTime.now
# var epoch = new DateTime(1970, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0)
