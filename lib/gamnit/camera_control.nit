# Simple camera control for user, as the method `accept_scroll_and_zoom`

	# Scrolling is accomplished by moving the camera on the XY plane and
	# zooming by moving it on the Z axis.
	#
	# This method has distinct implementations per platform.
	# On desktop computers, the mouse wheel changes the zoom level, and
	# holding down the middle mouse button scrolls the camera.
	# On Android, a two finger pinch and slide gesture zoom and scroll.
	#
	# Returns `true` if the event is used.
	#
	# Should be called from `App::accept_event` before accepting pointer events:
