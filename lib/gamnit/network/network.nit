# Easy client/server logic for games and simple distributed applications
#
# Both `gamnit::client` and `gamnit::server` can be used separately or
# together by importing `gamnit::network`.
# Use both modules to create an program that discover local servers
# or create one if none is found:

# ~~~
# redef fun handshake_app_name do return "network_test"
#
# # Discover local servers
# var servers = discover_local_servers
# if servers.not_empty then
#     # Try to connect to the first local server
#     var server_info = servers.first
#     var server = new RemoteServer(server_info)
#
#     if not server.connect then
#         print_error "Failed to connect to {server_info.address}:{server_info.port}"
#     else if not server.handshake then
#         print_error "Failed handshake with {server_info.address}:{server_info.port}"
#     else
#         # Connected!
#         print "Connected to {server_info.address}:{server_info.port}"
#
#         # Write something and close connection
#         server.writer.serialize "hello server"
#         server.socket.as(not null).close
#     end

#     var connect_port = 33729
#     print "Launching server: connect on {connect_port}, discovery on {discovery_port}"
