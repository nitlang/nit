# Implementation of BKTree
#
# As proposed by W. A. Burkhard and R. M. Keller in
# "Some approaches to best-match file searching" the BKTree data structure
# is usefull to speed-up spell checking based on the Levenshtein distance between
# words.
#
# With a BKTree, the complexity to find mispelled words in a dictionnary is *O(log n)*
# instead of *O(n)* with a dummy list.
#
# Example:
#
# ~~~
# # Create a new BKTree
# var tree = new BKTree
#
# # Index some words in the dictionnary for spell checking
# tree.add("book")
# tree.add("books")
# tree.add("cake")
# tree.add("boo")
# tree.add("cape")
# tree.add("boon")
# tree.add("cook")
# tree.add("cart")
#
# # Search suggestions in the BKTree
# assert tree.search("caqe").join(", ") == "\{1: cake\}, \{1: cape\}"
# ~~~
#
